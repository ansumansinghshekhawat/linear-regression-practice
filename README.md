# Linear Regression Practice (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains my **practice implementation of Linear Regression** using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

The main objective of this project is to understand the **core concepts of linear regression**, including data visualization, model training, and prediction, through hands-on practice.
